API Testing Framework
This framework provides a comprehensive testing solution for the API with proper isolation, reproducibility, and reliability.
Key Features

Test Isolation: Each test is fully independent and doesn't rely on shared state
Flexible Authentication: Tests can authenticate with API keys or JWT tokens
Robust Fixtures: Fixtures handle setup and teardown for all resources
Automatic Cleanup: Resources created during tests are automatically removed
Error Handling: Tests gracefully handle various API endpoint formats and errors
Comprehensive Coverage: Tests all API features including authentication, inference, transcription, and more

Prerequisites

Python 3.10+
Pytest
Requests library

Installation

# Install required packages
pip install pytest pytest-html requests

# Clone this repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

Configuration
Environment Variables
You can configure the test environment using environment variables:

API_BASE_URL: Base URL of the API (default: http://localhost:8000)
TEST_API_KEY: API key to use for all tests
TEST_TOKEN: JWT token to use for all tests
SAMPLE_VIDEO_PATH: Path to a sample video file for testing
SAMPLE_AUDIO_PATH: Path to a sample audio file for testing

Command-Line Options
Alternatively, you can specify options when running the tests:

python run_tests.py --api-url http://api.example.com --api-key your-api-key

Running Tests
Run All Tests

# Using run_tests.py
python run_tests.py --all

# Using pytest directly
pytest

Run Specific Test Categories

# Run authentication tests
python run_tests.py --auth

# Run inference tests
python run_tests.py --inference

# Run health endpoint tests
python run_tests.py --health

# Run multiple categories
python run_tests.py --auth --inference --health


Generate HTML Report

python run_tests.py --all --html
# Report will be saved as report.html

Wait for API to Start
If you're starting the API and tests in sequence, you can use the wait feature:

python run_tests.py --all --wait-for-api --wait-timeout 120

Test Structure
The test suite is organized into logical modules:

test_health.py: Tests for health and monitoring endpoints
test_auth.py: Tests for authentication, user registration, and API keys
test_inference.py: Tests for text inference functionality
test_transcription.py: Tests for audio transcription
test_video.py: Tests for video analysis
test_task.py: Tests for task management
test_subscription.py: Tests for subscription and payment functionality
test_integration.py: End-to-end integration tests

Fixtures
The test suite uses fixtures defined in conftest.py to handle setup and teardown:
Authentication Fixtures

api_url: Base URL of the API
test_user_credentials: User credentials for registration
registered_user: Registered test user data
auth_token: JWT token for authentication
api_key: API key for authentication
auth_headers: Headers with JWT token authentication
api_headers: Headers with API key authentication

Resource Fixtures

sample_text: Sample text for inference tests
sample_audio_path: Path to sample audio file
sample_video_path: Path to sample video file
db_session: Database session (if available)

Task Management Fixtures

wait_for_task: Function to wait for task completion
cleanup_task: Function to clean up tasks after tests

Best Practices for Adding Tests

Use Fixtures: Use existing fixtures for common operations
Test Independence: Make sure your test doesn't depend on other tests
Handle Alternatives: Handle alternative endpoint formats and error cases
Skip When Appropriate: Use pytest.skip() instead of failing when features aren't available
Clean Up Resources: Always clean up resources created during tests

Adding a New Test
Here's an example of adding a new test:

def test_new_feature(self, api_url, api_headers):
    """Test a new feature."""
    # Prepare data
    data = {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}
    
    # Send request
    response = requests.post(
        f"{api_url}/api/new-feature",
        json=data,
        headers=api_headers
    )
    
    # Skip if feature not available
    if response.status_code == 404:
        pytest.skip("New feature not available")
    
    # Verify response
    assert response.status_code == 200, f"Unexpected status: {response.status_code}, {response.text}"
    
    # Validate data
    result = response.json()
    assert "result" in result, "Result missing in response"

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

API Connection Failed: Make sure the API is running and accessible at the specified URL
Authentication Failed: Check your API key or token is valid
Tests Skip Too Much: Some endpoints might not be available or have different paths
Slow Tests: Set appropriate timeouts for task completion

Debugging Tips

Use --verbose to see more details about the tests
Look for skipped tests to see what features aren't available
Check the HTML report for detailed test results
Run one test at a time to isolate issues

About the Refactoring
This test suite has been refactored to solve several issues:

Dependency Between Tests: Tests were dependent on each other, causing cascading failures
Authentication Issues: Tests failed due to missing or invalid API keys
Model Validation Issues: Tests weren't aligned with actual API responses
Setup Problems: Missing centralized setup for test environment

The refactoring includes:

Isolated Tests: Each test is now self-contained with its own fixtures
Flexible Authentication: Better handling of API keys and tokens
Robust Error Handling: Tests handle all error cases gracefully
Standardized Structure: Consistent approach to testing across all modules
Automatic Cleanup: Resources are automatically cleaned up after tests
Skip Instead of Fail: Tests skip when features aren't available instead of failing
Clear Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for running and extending tests
